#What is MINT?

1. MINT is interpretor of graphical modeling lanugage, Mechanica.
2. Mechanica can describe 3D models in parametric way. So you can use it as parametric CAD.
3. Mechanica can manipulate 3D models. So you can use it as 3D graphic processor. You may be able to use it as CAE or CAM.
4. Mechanica can cupsulate it's code. In other words, Mechanica is 'Objective'. So you can reuse it's code for other project.

If I explain MINT in a sentence...

The MINT is 3D design software which use graphical modeling language.

#Mechanica 5 Zen

1. Reuse is productive.
2. Make the box usable and let them not to think about inside.
3. Part is good, system is better, but product is best.
4. Bits is faster than atom.
5. Make it, fail it, fix it, in the fastest way.
6. Conquer complexity by abstracting.
